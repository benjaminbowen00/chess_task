# Criton Coding Challenge

You can carry out this exercise in your own time, in your IDE of choice.

This project will give you the chance to prove your skills in different areas.

Some things we'll watch out for are:
* Clean Code
* Unit Tests/Test-driven Development (TDD)
* Design patterns
* Refactoring


__STEPS__  

1. Fork your own copy of this repository by either:   

    * Public - Fork a copy into your own public github account   
    * Private - Fork a copy onto your local machine (Download the repository), or onto a private repository if you can.


2. Read the description of the project below.

3. Commit updated code to your repository.

4. Once complete.
    * Public - Email the link to your repository to [ron.crawford@critonapps.com](mailto:ron.crawford@critonapps.com?subject=Developer Code Challenge Completed)  
    * Private - Zip your code into a single file and email it to [ron.crawford@critonapps.com](mailto:ron.crawford@critonapps.com?subject=Developer ChessProject Completed)


__DESCRIPTION__

Pretend that you are joining a team that has just started writing code and may be doing it wrong. Your goal in the long run is to build a chess game and you need to pick up what other developers have already done. You wonâ€™t be writing it all at once and the first iteration will be focused on some basic functionality of the Chessboard and some simple movements of the pawns.

The chessboard will be a grid of width X and height Y, being (0, 0) the lower left-hand corner, and (X, Y) the top right-hand corner.

Black pieces start at rows 6 and 7, and white pieces start at rows 0 and 1. Having said that, you can set any initial configuration you may like and replay games. 
Pieces can have two different types of movement: move and capture (we will ignore capture for this exercise). For now, we only want to implement pawns' basic movement, which for now, will only move forward one space and capture in diagonal (forward).

We'd like you to get all the unit tests passing. As you'll be in the project for a long time, we'd like you to also think about how you'd implement this, what other tests might be necessary and what you'd do to aid future development of other features.

Whether you want to implement your ideas or roughly explain them in written, is entirely up to you and the time you want to spend on the test. The most important thing is that you put yourself in the place of taking over this project and seeing it through to completion. Be ready to discuss these with us in your face to face interview.
